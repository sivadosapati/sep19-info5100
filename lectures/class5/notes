final keyword :
	data with final scope can't be changed after they are initialized
	methods with final scope can't be overriden in the child classes
	classes with final scope can't be extended by another class
static keyword
	static variables are the ones that are common for all the objects of that class
	static methods can be invoked through class as against an Object

packages
	logical organization of java classes
	
/*catch (RainingException re) {

Exception Handling

	- A scenario where an unexpected problem happens in the code
	- Use try() and catch() to handle the exception
	- Use throw new xxx() when you want to throw an Exception
	- Use multiple catch blocks to catch different types of Exceptions
	- Use finally() block to do an operation irrespective of an exception or not

What is the purpose of an Abstract class?

abstract class Vehicle{

}

abstract class Fruit{

}

class Apple extends Fruit{

}

abstract class Professor{

}

class JavaProfessor extends Professor{

}

class DatabaseProfessor extends Professor{

}

class Professor{
	ProfessorType type;
}

enum{
	Java, C, Arts, Datbase

}


class Food{
	FoodType ft;
	void eat(){
		if( ft == FoodType.Burger) eatWithHand();
		if( ft == FoodType.Icecream) eatWithSpoon();
	}
}

enum FoodType{
	Burger, Chocolate, Icecream;
}

Food f = new Food(FoodType.Burger);

What is the difference between Abstract class and Interface?

- Class can be extended only once by another class and multiple interfaces can be implemented by a class

abstract class Phone{

}

class Camera{
	void takePicture(){}
}

interface Camera{
	void takePicture();
}

interface Printer{
	void print();
}

interface InternetBrowser{
	void browse();
}

class IPhone extends Phone implements Camera, Printer, InternetBrowser{

}

class Laptop implements Camera, Printer, InternetBrowser{

}

interface Energy{
	void provideCalories();
}

Apple is a Fruit and gives some Energy


class Apple extends Fruit implements Energy{


}
