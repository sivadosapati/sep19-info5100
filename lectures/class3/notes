OOPS Concepts : Object Oriented Programming Semantics

Objects, Creation - Construction (Constructors), Destruction (Destructors)
Encapsulation
	- Make all the data in a class private
	- Define getter method to access the data (only for reading)
	- Define setter method to modify the data (only for changing)
		- Potentially write logic in the setter if you want to control how the data can be changed

Abstraction

Phone a;
Phone b;

void makeCall(Phone b){
	makeContact(b);
	openConnection(b);
	establishNetwork(b);
	exchangeWords(b);

}
